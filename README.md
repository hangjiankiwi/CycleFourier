# CycleFourier

Utilisation of Fourier analysis to investigate the cyclic behaviour of environmental data

Periodic waveform could be defined using a series of trigonometry functions. Environmental observations(e.g. streamflow, water quality observations, river levels, etc) are responses to environmental stresses. These stresses could be periodic, superimposed periodic forms and noise.

This Fourier analysis could be useful to investigate the periodic characteristic of the environmental observations or differentiate the independent datasets.
